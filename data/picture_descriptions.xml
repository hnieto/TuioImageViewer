	<picture name="bwave_CASC.jpg">Description: The image shows the resulting turbulence as water flows past a NACA 0024. The visualization was crated using a Virtual Rheoscopic Fluid plot. This technique enables novel vector plots in VisIt on a wide variety of data and the visual comparison of the quality of different technique variations. Visualization by: Doug G. Dommermuth, Science Applications International Corporation (Breaking Waves)</picture>

	<picture name="nara3.png">Description: The image depicts the preservation risk of the collection. The pink outlines show the collection’s nested structure. Green boxes represent file formats with low preservation risk; blue represents medium risk; and red represents files at risk because they rely on proprietary software that could be discontinued.

	<picture name="schizo1.png">Description: Shown in the visualization is a bio-molecular rendering of the human Dopamine D3 receptor, with the drug Eticlopride shown in the center. This giga-pixel image consists not of pixels, but of 2000 unique bio-molecular renderings of molecules involved in Schizophrenia that form a mosaic of a single larger image. This truly massive image was rendered at the Texas Advanced Computing Center's Visualization Laboratory and provides not only a macro-scale understanding of the disorder, but also deep insight into the complexity and scale of the datasets involved and the attempts to understand it.

	<picture name="makoto.jpg">Description: The three-dimensional enstrophy field shown is one of a number of different visualizations on the decay of compressible, homogeneous, isotropic turbulence. The enstrophy distribution is important for understanding the decay of turbulence. This visualization shows large three-dimensional structures which are related to the so-called energy-containing eddies. In addition, a cascade of structures are visible. The smaller structures will dissipate, leaving the large structures. We are interested in how turbulence can help to improve combustion processes such as more complete combustion, reduced NOx production and so forth.

	<picture name="starry_night.jpg">Description: Starry Night (Dutch: De sterrennacht) is a painting by the Dutch post-impressionist artist Vincent van Gogh. The painting depicts the view outside of his sanitarium room window at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence (located in southern France) at night, although it was painted from memory during the day. It has been in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, part of the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest, since 1941.</picture>
